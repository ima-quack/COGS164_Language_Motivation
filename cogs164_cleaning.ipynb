    "# Motivation to Take Language Courses\n",
    "---\n",
    "We are all more connected to each other than ever before because of various things such as the social media, articles, and even the news; therefore because of this, exposure to various different languages become everso more common. Letâ€™s look at  KPOP in recent years; it has had an explosion in popularity in America culture despite most of the media being in Korean rather than English. With over 58% of the student population at UCSD identifying with ethnicities where the ethnic language is not English, hence our interest lies within the motivators which bring students within our body to learn additional languages. Specifically our question is what motivators drive the acquisition of language for students currently/had taking language courses at UCSD? Are there differences in these motivators which effect acquisition and post-course language retention?Some of our factors include things like \"Familial intentions, cultural appreciation, desire to better explore, or even \"I want to get through my GEs\"\n"
