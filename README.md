# COGS164: Motivation to Learn Languages

In an ever-more interconnected world, exposure to various different languages become everso more common. Think of KPOP which has had an explosion in popularity within America despite most of the media being in Korean rather than English. With over 58% of the student population at UCSD identifying with ethnicities where the ethnic language is not English, this topic is even relevant here. Hence our interest lies within the motivators which bring students within our body to learn additional languages. Familial intentions, cultural appreciation, desire to better explore, or even "I want to get through my GEs", what motivators drive the acquisition of language for students currently/had taking language courses at UCSD? Are there differences in these motivators which effect acquisition and post-course language retention?

This project was conducted over the course of UCSD's Spring 2023 Quarter from March 29th - June 16th. The descriptions added and repository structure were updated post-hoc for the purposes of curious explorers of the research as well as a refresher to keep the research fresh. 

## Structure of Repository
The files for this project are contained in three main directories:
- `code`
    - This directory contains the collection of source code for our data analysis. Files are separated out according to the general wrangling or analysis being conducted as a way to separate out the analysis process in a more digestable manner.
- `data`
    - This directory contains the source data set which was collected from a sample of UCSD students across various secondary language courses.
- `images`
    - This directory contains the render of various plots and analysis which were used to craft our presentation for the research.
