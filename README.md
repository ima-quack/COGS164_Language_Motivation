# COGS164: Motivation to Learn Languages

In an ever-more interconnected world, exposure to various different languages become everso more common. Think of KPOP which has had an explosion in popularity within America despite most of the media being in Korean rather than English. With over 58% of the student population at UCSD identifying with ethnicities where the ethnic language is not English, this topic is even relevant here. Hence our interest lies within the motivators which bring students within our body to learn additional languages. Familial intentions, cultural appreciation, desire to better explore, or even "I want to get through my GEs", what motivators drive the acquisition of language for students currently/had taking language courses at UCSD? Are there differences in these motivators which effect acquisition and post-course language retention?
